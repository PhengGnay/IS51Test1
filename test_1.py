"""
The program is asking which option is best, in order to decide which offers more money.
The first option is stating 100 dollars per day for 10 days.
The second option is 1 dollar a day with it being doubled each day for 10 days.
Two functions will occur, function 1 will show the result for option 1, and function 2 will show for option 2.

function 1 will output 100 * 10.
function 2 will loop ten times, within every loop it will double the amount to the total

If the amount is equal, we output to the user "Option 1 and Option 2 pays the same"
If option 1 is better, we output to the user "Option 1 is better"
If option 2 is better, we output to the user "Option 2 is better"
